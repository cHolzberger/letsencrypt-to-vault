## How certs are stored

Path in Vault consists of: your vault cert path and site name. 
For example, if you have path prefix like secret/my/certs and certs for two sites one.site and another.site
it will be secret/my/certs/my.site and /secret/my/certs/another.site.
This script sends in Vault fullchain and privkey and save them in key and cert fields.

## Docker

This docker container uses and exposes */webroot-dir*(by default) for webroot plugin.
You can use it to share it to your **containerized proxy** by volumes_from.
If it's not containerized, just use `-v` flag to share it in place that you need(/usr/share/nginx/webroot for example).

Example:
```
docker run -ti -v /my/path/for-webroot:/webroot-dir ket4yii/letsencrypt-to-vault renew -t something-uuidgenerated -p secret/my/certs/certs -a http://vault.addr:8200
```

## Kubernetes

Sample CronJob is in .kube directory. If you want to use it, just change `args` and `volumes` section in configuration if you need. Default schedule is to run the script once in a three months.
